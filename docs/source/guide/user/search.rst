=============================

Baruwa supports many of the search tricks you use in popular web search engines.

Search with an exact phrase
===========================

To search for an exact phrase enclose the phrase in quotes ``"Blocked message"``

Search for one or other
=======================

Use the pipe character ``|`` to separate the phrases ``"Barrack Obama"`` | ``"Mike Tyson"``

Search using a wildcard
=======================

Use the star character ``*`` For example ``boy*`` will match ``boy``, ``boyfriend``

Search using the negate operator
================================

``shaken !stirred`` or ``shaken -stirred`` will match phrases with shaken but not
``shaken stirred``

Search using grouping
=====================

``(red | green | blue) car`` will match ``red car``, ``green car`` or ``blue car``

Search Specific fields
======================

.. note::
	It is also possible to limit your search to specific fields, the field operators
	will be provided later.
