MTA Intergration
================

Baruwa can be integrated with the MTA to ensure that the MTA uses the
configuration data in Baruwa to make a range of decisions.

Examples of what is possible is DKIM, Relaying information, Delivery
information, Approved and Banned sender lists, SMTP authentication
and a lot more.
