====================================
Baruwa Contributor License Agreement
====================================

Contributing Source Code and Documentation
==========================================

For all contributions to Baruwa >= 2.0 we ask contributors to send us a 
contributor license agreement form by email. This agreement establishes a
relationship between us and the contributor, gives details on what it
means when the contributor grants permission for their work to be included
in Baruwa, and enables us to be better stewards of Baruwa.

With the contributor agreement chosen by ``Two nations consulting services c.c``,
the Harmony CLA, the contributor gives ``Two nations consulting services c.c`` a
license to use their contributions. The contributor continues to own the copyright
in the contribution, with full rights to re-use, re-distribute, and continue 
modifying the contributed code, allowing them to also share that contribution
with other projects.

We've tried to keep the agreement as simple and comprehensible as possible.
It comes in two flavors, one for
`individual contributors <https://www.baruwa.com/downloads/Baruwa-Individual.pdf>`_
and one for `entities <https://www.baruwa.com/downloads/Baruwa-Entity.pdf>`_ 
(companies, foundations, or other organizations).

If you are making a contribution that is not your work (for example, a patch or
library written by someone else), please contact us on whether any additional
steps are needed.

How to submit:
==============

The Baruwa Copyright License Agreement should be signed with the GPG key used
to submit your contributions; please fill in your name and contact information
on the agreement form.

Thank you.
